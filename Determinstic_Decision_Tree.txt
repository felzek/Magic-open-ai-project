(Basic Turn Strategy that we give the computer to start with)

Player Phase 1
0 - creature
1 - spell
2 - land
8 - pass

1) multinomial distribution where each choice has a probability associated with it (one attempt):

Playing a land (2) - 70%
Playing a spell (1) - 10%
Playing a creature (0) - 10%
Passing (8) - 10%

	> If player has a land then he just plays it:
		Playing a creature (0) - 45%
		Playing a spell (1) - 45%
		Pass (8) - 10%

	> If player doesn't have land:
		Playing a creature (0) - 45%
		Playing a spell (1) - 45%
		Pass (8) - 10%

2) Player plays a spell

1 - Player 1 Life Total
2 - Player 2 Life Total
3 - Player 1 untapped creature
4 - Player 1 tapped creature
5 - Player 2 untapped creature
6 - Player 2 tapped creature

	> P1 plays a spell
		1 - 5%
		2 - 85/3 %
		3 - 5%
		4 - 5%
		5 - 85/3 %
		6 - 85/3 %

	> P2 plays a spell
		1 - 85/3%
		2 - 5%
		3 - 85/3%
		4 - 85/3%
		5 - 5%
		6 - 5%

3) Player plays a creature (nothing really happens)

Player Passes and move on to Phase 2

1) Player Phase 2 (Attack Phase):
	> Favor choosing max number of creatures (n):
		-  0,1,2,...,n-1 creatures attacked: 100/(n+2) %
		-  n creatures attacked: 2*[100/(n+2)] %

Phase 3

1) Opposing Player Phase 3 (Blocking Phase):
	> Favor choosing max number of creatures (n):
		-  0,1,2,...,n-1 creatures used to block: 100/(n+2) %
		-  n creatures used to block: 2*[100/(n+2)] %

Update after every decision computer makes: (the tough part)
Punishment for doing stupid things or illegal things
Reward for doing good things
